# Developmental Editing {#developmental}

Youʼve finished your manuscript, but youʼre not ready for the mechanical side of editing yet. Instead, youʼre looking for someone to point out:

* {{< red >}}Plot Development Complications:{{< /red >}} Where places in the plot are weak (inconsistent with the overall plot, cumbersome, too convenient, etc.); problems with pacing for the exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution; and chapter sub-plot development issues.
* {{< red >}}Character Development Issues:{{< /red >}} Whether or not your characters are unique from the other characters in the manuscript (unique identifiers); if theyʼre static or dynamic; and if theyʼre believable (strengths and weaknesses).
* {{< red >}}World-Building Hiccups:{{< /red >}} If the setting for the manuscript makes sense; whether or not foreign terms (common with science-fiction/fantasy manuscripts) are defined in the prose in a way thatʼs not cumbersome.
* {{< red >}}Voice/Pacing:{{< /red >}} If the manuscript is consistently in the same tense and point of view.
* {{< red >}}Contradictions/Inconsistencies:{{< /red >}} If characters are behaving differently than they have in the past (and itʼs not related to the plot or character development); inconsistencies in technology use (common in science-fiction manuscripts); and contradictions in events.

Deliverables for Developmental Editing:

* {{< red >}}Editorʼs Letter:{{< /red >}} An overview letter explaining the overall impression of the manuscriptʼs readability, likeability, and marketability for the chosen audience; chapter-by-chapter summary detailing the positive and negative aspects of the chapters; character development, motivations, likeability, and use of dialogue.
* {{< red >}}Annotated Word Document:{{< /red >}} In-document comments pointing out the positives and negatives of the manuscript.
* {{< red >}}Style Guide:{{< /red >}} A document outlining the spelling for proper nouns and foreign terms for the future copyeditor and proofreader, as well as any notes on specific styles chosen by the author (number formatting, as an example).

# Line Editing {#lineediting}

Line editing involves looking at each paragraph, sentence, and phrase within a manuscript to make sure it reads well. If youʼve ever heard of “showing rather than telling” or “passive voice” in a manuscript, then you know what line editing addresses.

Line editing fixes:

* {{< red >}}Awkward Wording:{{< /red >}} Whether itʼs a phrase not jiving with the rest of the sentence or an entire sentence gunking up the flow of the writing, line editing will fix those awkward moments.
* {{< red >}}Passive Voice:{{< /red >}} This hiccup happens often for new writers, but with a little tweaking, it can easily be fixed.
* {{< red >}}Redundancy and Consistency:{{< /red >}} Repetitive wording and phrases sticks out substantially for a reader, especially starting three sentences in a row with the same word. Inconsistent tense and points of view confuse a reader, and line editing looks for those moments of confusion.
* {{< red >}}Wordiness:{{< /red >}} When three sentences can be condensed into one concise sentence, it should be done to avoid beating the reader over the head with a description or an action.
* {{< red >}}Word Choice:{{< /red >}} Looking for errors in word choice takes into account the audience of the manuscript, such as their age and reading skills.

Deliverables for Line Editing:

* {{< red >}}Editorʼs Letter:{{< /red >}} An overview letter explaining the overall impression of the manuscriptʼs readability, likeability, and marketability for the chosen audience and explanations for the types of changes made in the document (fixing passive voice, removing excessive wording, etc.) to better help the author see these errors in their writing in the future.
* {{< red >}}Annotated Word Document:{{< /red >}} Track Changes will be turned on to facilitate the author accepting/rejecting the changes made easily.
* {{< red >}}Clean Word Document:{{< /red >}} A document with all of the Track Changes accepted in case the author would like to read through it without the red.

# Copyediting {#copyediting}

Youʼve already had someone complete developmental editing, so you know the manuscript is in good shape, but it needs someone to look at the mechanics of your grammar, spelling, syntax, and symbol formatting. Thatʼs where copyediting comes in!

Self-Publishing Genieʼs copyediting services include:

* {{< red >}}Grammar:{{< /red >}} According to the Chicago Manual of Style, Seventeenth Edition, “grammar is the set of rules governing how words are put together in sentences to communicate ideas.” Is your noun-verb agreement correct? Are your adjectives positioned correctly? Are your phrasal adjectives hyphenated properly?
* {{< red >}}Punctuation:{{< /red >}} Periods, commas, semi-colons, colons, question marks, exclamation marks, hyphens, dashes, parentheses, brackets, braces, slashes, quotation marks, apostrophes, spaces, lists, and multiple punctuation marks all have rules for their usage. Formatting an ellipsis, em dash, and improper punctuation with quotation marks are some of the most common punctuation errors out there, not to mention the commas!
* {{< red >}}Spelling:{{< /red >}} Any copyeditor following the Chicago Manual of Style will tell you the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is the preferred one, but thereʼs so much more than just proper spelling of terms. Thereʼs the distinctive treatment of words (italics for foreign terms); formatting of names, terms, and titles of works; formatting of numbers (the one to ten rule or the one to one hundred rule); treatment of abbreviations; and mathematical symbols and terms, just to name a few. Spelling and the treatment of words is a broad category with many rules. Copyeditors know each one.
* {{< red >}}Quotations and Dialogue:{{< /red >}} Whether or not to use a comma or period with double quotation marks (dialogue tags, for example), setting off poetry, creating block quotations where necessary, formatting run-in quotations, quotations taking up more than a single paragraph, single-word speech, direct discourse, and so much more are a part of this category.
* {{< red >}}Style Guide Consistency Check:{{< /red >}} Copyeditors provide a style guide to their clients if itʼs the first type of editing theyʼre providing. This allows the author to point out which spelling they want for a specific proper noun if itʼs spelled more than one way in a manuscript. For example, Ann versus Anne.

Deliverables for Copyediting:

* {{< red >}}Editorʼs Letter:{{< /red >}} The editorʼs letter for a copyedit will have an overview letter and a section explaining each type of error found in the manuscript, as well as ways to look out for and fix those errors in the future. This is rarely something other editors provide, but I find clients want to improve their writing, and this editorʼs letter aims to do that.
* {{< red >}}Annotated Word Document:{{< /red >}} The annotated Word document will have the Track Changes showing to allow the author to accept/reject the changes as they see fit.
* {{< red >}}Clean Document:{{< /red >}} All of the track changes will be accepted for this document in case the writer would like to read through without all of that red.
* {{< red >}}Style Guide:{{< /red >}} If one was not provided during the developmental editing stage, then one will be provided with copyediting for future proofreading purposes.
