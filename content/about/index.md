Virtually located, Self-Publishing Genie is a digital option for self-publishers and boutique publishers looking for professional editing and book design services. 

Self-Publishing Genie was founded on the belief independent authors and boutique publishers deserve the same attention, care to detail, and professional services the “big guys” receive from the Big Five publishing houses—without the big price tag. With eleven years of experience backing that tall order, the founder of Self-Publishing Genie, Nadene Seiters, understands what it takes to take an author’s rough manuscript and turn it into a finished product ready for publication.

Co-owner of Self-Publishing Genie is James Seiters, the formatting guru who understands each and every line of code necessary to make an eBook look perfect, as well as how to work wonders creating a paperback/hardcover book for publication on sites such as Amazon KDP, Barnes and Noble, Smashwords, Lulu, and many others. With over twenty years of coding in his previous work life, James can meet every demand for self-publishers and boutique publishers alike.

As a cohesive team, Nadene and James are capable of taking a first draft to a finished product ready for publication!
